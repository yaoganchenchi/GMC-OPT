# GMC-OPT

Author: Chi Chen

Language: Matlab 2021a/2023a

Global Multilayer Canopy OPTimization (GMC-OPT) is designed to scale sub-daily leaf-level carbon fluxes to the canopy level. The model integrates three core components: canopy radiative transfer, optimization-based physiology, and energy balance. The program will output multilayered simulation of key varaibles such as: gross primary productivity, transpiration, stomatal conductance, Vcmax, Jmax, and etc at leaf and canopy levels.

If you use the program, please cite:

To run the program, excute "GMCOPT_main".

Example inputs:

CO2 is obtained from NOAA, and leaf area index is obtained from MODIS. Meteorology variables and benchmark EC fluxes are processed from FLUXNET2015.
